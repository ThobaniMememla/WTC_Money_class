# WTC_Money_class
The Money class uses a BigInteger for Rands and an int for cents, ensuring precision and scalability. It follows an immutable design, returning new Money objects for operations. Refactoring Account classes to use Money improves accuracy. The BigInteger approach is better for large-scale, high-precision systems.
